- **Dark Mode Support**: Built-in dark theme for comfortable viewing in all environments

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **React 18**: For building the component-based UI
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code and better developer experience
- **Vite**: For fast development and optimized production builds
- **React Router**: For client-side routing with protected routes
- **@hello-pangea/dnd**: For drag-and-drop functionality
- **Mantine UI**: For modern, accessible UI components
- **TanStack React Query**: For efficient server state management
- **TipTap**: For rich text editing capabilities
- **DOMPurify**: For secure HTML sanitization
- **Zod**: For runtime validation

### Development Tools

- **ESLint & Prettier**: For consistent code style and quality
- **Husky & lint-staged**: For pre-commit hooks and automated code quality checks
- **Commitlint**: For conventional commit message enforcement
- **TypeScript**: For static type checking

## 🏗️ Architecture
